Steps to use this properly:
1. Download Audio_file_algorithm.py
2. If you wish to add more data, you can divide it into 3 second segments using wavsplit.py, just specify the path and the wav file names
3. Create a folder called Conversation Data and the Direct Conversation and Both wav data folders into it
4. Take Background Conversation(1),(2),and (3) and combine them into one folder called Background Conversation and put this into the Conversation Data folder
5. Open and run Audio_file_algorithm.py to create a neural network that processes these wav files and makes predictions
